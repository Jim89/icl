Item 1.    Business

        Bookham is a Delaware corporation and was incorporated on June 29, 2004. On September 10, 2004, pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under UK law, Bookham became the publicly traded parent company of the Bookham Technology plc group of companies, including Bookham Technology plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales whose stock was previously traded on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ National Market under the symbol "BKHM." Pursuant to the scheme of arrangement, all outstanding ordinary shares of Bookham Technology plc were exchanged for shares of our common stock on a ten for one basis. All references in this document to the number of shares, per share amounts and market prices have been restated to reflect the closing of the scheme of arrangement. In connection with the scheme of arrangement, Bookham changed its corporate domicile from the United Kingdom to the United States. Bookham assumed Bookham Technology plc's Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and financial reporting history effective September 10, 2004. As a result, management deems Bookham Technology plc's consolidated business activities prior to September 10, 2004 to represent Bookham's consolidated business activities as if Bookham and Bookham Technology plc had historically been the same entity. References to "the Company" refer to Bookham, Inc. without its subsidiaries. References to "we," "our," "us" or "Bookham" mean the Company and its subsidiaries and refers to Bookham's consolidated business activities since September 10, 2004 and Bookham Technology plc's consolidated business activities prior to September 10, 2004. In contemplation of the scheme arrangement, Bookham Technology plc changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to the Sunday closest to June 30. Bookham's fiscal year end is also the Sunday closest to June 30. Accordingly, our financial statements have been prepared for the six months ended July 3, 2004, and now will be prepared for fifty-two/fifty-three week cycles going forward. In view of this change, this Form 10-K is a transition report and includes financial information for the six-month transition period ended July 3, 2004 and for the twelve- month periods ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. In addition, we changed our functional currency from pounds sterling to the U.S. dollar effective September 10, 2004. The change in functional currency is a result of the change in the principal economic environment in which we operate. In addition, our common stock is only traded on the Nasdaq National Market, where previously, our ordinary shares had been traded on the London Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq National Market. Our annual reports on Form 20-F for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 contained Bookham Technology plc's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United

        On March 8, 2004, we completed our merger with New Focus, Inc. The acquisition of New Focus added new product lines that service markets such as research and semiconductor capital equipment, as well as a direct sales force and group distributors. For the year ended December 28, 2003, New Focus reported revenues of $27.1 million for a gross margin of 22.7%. The acquisition of New Focus also contributed additional cash resources of approximately $105.0 million to fund our operations and a facility in Shenhzen, China which we intend to use as a comparatively low cost manufacturing site. 

        On June 10, 2004, we acquired the entire issued share capital of Onetta, Inc., based in Sunnyvale, California for 2,764,030 shares of common stock valued at $24.7 million. Onetta provides optical amplifier modules and subsystems for communications networks. 

        On July 21, 2004, we announced that we had sold JCA Technology, Inc. to Endwave Corporation for a consideration of $6.0 million. JCA Technology, Inc., which was based in San Jose, California and acquired as part of the New Focus transaction, primarily supplies a comprehensive line of radio frequency (RF) amplifiers for defense applications. 

Industry Background 

        In the 1990s, telecommunications network vendors and data communication vendors increasingly incorporated optical systems into communications infrastructures, taking advantage of the ability of fiber optic systems to support dramatically greater bandwidths than traditional copper networks. Widespread adoption of fiber optic systems has significantly improved the ability of these networks to transmit and manage the high volume of voice, video and data traffic generated in recent years by the growth of the Internet and other innovative communications technologies. The build-out of fiber optic networks required optical components that combine, generate, detect, manipulate and process light signals as they are transmitted. 

        By the late 1990s, excess spending on optical telecommunications systems and the resulting demand for optical components had insulated existing component suppliers from normal business practices, resulting in production inefficiencies and inflated profit margins, as well as attracting new entrants into the market. Since 2001, however, as a result of declining market conditions, network carriers have drastically reduced their investments in the infrastructure and technology required to grow and support their networks. This resulting reduction in demand for optical systems has subjected optical component suppliers to more traditional business disciplines, such as appropriate capacity utilization, manufacturing economies of scale and prudent operating cost structures. In response, optical component suppliers have been required to reduce manufacturing and operating cost overheads dramatically in order to sustain their businesses during a period of reduced demand and to ensure they achieve cost efficiencies required to meet their customers' pricing demands. 

        In addition, most large optical systems vendors have historically used components developed and produced by their own organizations to fulfill their needs for optical components. However, as the market for optical systems declined, optical systems vendors were exposed to many of the same inefficiency challenges facing independent optical component companies. These challenges, as well as the prioritization on optical systems design manufacturing, resulted in the divestiture or closure of many captive optical component businesses. As a result, during the last two years, optical systems vendors have been seeking component suppliers with a depth of technology expertise and breadth of product portfolio that no longer exists within their own organizations and the manufacturing capabilities that they have sold, outsourced or eliminated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




        These trends have created significant pressure on optical component suppliers to consolidate so they can meet system vendor demands for complete solutions by developing and manufacturing the key components for optical networks on a rapid and efficient basis. In addition, market trends have created significant pressure on component suppliers to consolidate in order to achieve the critical mass that permits them to capture a larger revenue base, achieve enhanced economies of scale and maintain more comprehensive relationships with key customers. As a result, there has been significant consolidation in the marketplace, including our acquisition of the optical components businesses of Nortel Networks Corporation and Marconi Optical Components Limited and the acquisition by Avanex, Inc., of the optical components business of Alcatel, Inc. We believe that the trend towards consolidation will continue, providing companies positioned as consolidators with the opportunity to capture increased market share, key customers and improved profits through increased capacity utilization. 

        The market for optical components continues to evolve. Telecommunications network vendors are requiring optical component suppliers to take advantage of developments in product integration and miniaturization to provide solutions incorporating multiple optical components on a single subsystem or module, thereby reducing the need for component assembly and additional testing by the vendor. Historically, the market for telecommunications products has been characterized by high performance, high cost and significant product customization, while the market for data communications products has been characterized by high volume, low cost and standardization. This distinction is increasingly blurred as technologies evolve that cost-effectively address both sets of applications at attractive price points, creating an opportunity to leverage technologies that meet the broader demands of the combined markets. In addition, the optical technology originally developed for the communications industry, such as high-power lasers, is also increasingly being deployed in industrial, automotive, aerospace and military applications. Exploitation of these opportunities offers optical component suppliers the opportunity to achieve improved margins and leverage embedded research and development expertise in new applications that are less dependent on the cycles of the telecommunications industry. 

        In 2003, it was estimated that the market for optical components for use in optical communications applications was approximately $2.0 billion, of which we estimate approximately $1.2 billion was for telecommunications networks and approximately $800 million was for data communication networks. We also believe a significant opportunity exists for the innovative technology solutions developed for these optical communications applications to be applied in a variety of other non-telecommunications markets, including military and industrial applications. 

        To succeed in such a challenging and evolving market, we believe that an optical component supplier must be able to: 

•
Offer a broad product portfolio of components; 


•
Maintain strong relationships with the world's leading optical systems vendors; 


•
Develop and maintain technologies that can be leveraged into new markets; 


•
Have integrated, cost efficient manufacturing facilities with conservatively managed manufacturing and operating overhead; and 


•
Be positioned as an industry consolidator with a proven track record. 
Bookham's Solution 

        We have responded to the demands of the optical components market by maintaining our focus on research and development, consolidating manufacturing facilities and reducing overhead, and pursuing an acquisition and consolidation strategy that has allowed us to achieve greater economies of scale and a broader product portfolio.

•
We believe that we offer one of the most comprehensive end-to-end portfolios of optical component solutions to the telecommunications market. We believe that as a result of our broad product portfolio, we are a significant and important supplier to leading optical systems vendors. 


•
We have employed a focused acquisition and consolidation strategy. Our senior management team has demonstrated its capacity to acquire and integrate industry participants. We acquired the optical components businesses of Marconi Optical Components Limited and Nortel Networks Corporation in 2002. Additionally, we acquired Ignis Optics, Inc. and the business of Cierra Photonics, Inc. in 2003 and New Focus and Onetta in 2004. These acquisitions significantly increased our product portfolio and manufacturing expertise, while providing established relationships with leading optical systems vendors. 


•
As part of the process of integrating acquired businesses and companies, we have in the past year taken significant steps to rationalize production capacity, adjust headcount and restructure resources to reduce manufacturing and operating overhead. During 2003, we consolidated nine manufacturing facilities into three. In 2004, we announced a restructuring plan which includes moving the majority of our assembly and test operations from our site in Paignton, U.K. to our facility in Shenzhen, China. 


•
To further diversify our product portfolio, we are pursuing laser, semiconductor and other technologies for non-communications applications. 
        As a result of these actions, we believe Bookham is well positioned to meet the demands of the optical components market and expand into new markets. 

Bookham's Strategy 

        Our goal is to maintain and enhance our position through the following steps:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Switzerland, Canada, Italy and the United States. In addition to our direct sales and marketing force, we also sell and market our products through international sales representatives and resellers that extends our commercial reach to smaller geographic locations and customers that are not currently adequately covered by our sales offices. Our products targeted at research and defense applications are sold through catalogs. 

        Our products typically have a long sales cycle. The period of time between our initial contact with a customer to the receipt of an actual purchase order is frequently six months to a year or more. In addition, many customers perform, and require us to perform, extensive process and product evaluation and testing of components before entering into purchase arrangements. 

        In certain instances, support services for our products include customer service and technical support. Customer service representatives assist customers with orders, warranty returns and other administrative functions. Technical support engineers provide customers with answers to technical and product-related questions. Technical support engineers also provide application support to customers who have incorporated our products into custom applications. 

        We are subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. These risks include: currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues; greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods; difficulty in enforcing or adequately protecting our intellectual property; foreign taxes; political, legal and economic instability in foreign markets; and foreign regulations. Any of these risks, or any other risks related to our foreign operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Intellectual Property 

        We believe that our proprietary technology provides us with an important competitive advantage, and we intend to continue to protect our technology, as appropriate, including design, process and assembly aspects. We believe that our intellectual property portfolio is a valuable strategic asset that we can use in conjunction with the technologies of the companies with whom we collaborate to develop sophisticated solutions and applications for use in optical networking. Our portfolio is supplemented by our extensive expertise and significant application and process engineering know-how developed by our personnel, including personnel who joined us from Nortel Networks Corporation, Marconi Optical Components Limited, Cierra Photonics, Ignis Optics, New Focus and Onetta. We believe that the future success of our business will depend on our ability to translate our intellectual property portfolio and the technological expertise and innovation of our personnel into new and enhanced products. 

        As of September 10, 2004, we held 285 U.S. patents and 161 non-U.S. patents, and we had approximately 355 patent applications pending in various countries. We maintain an active program to identify technology appropriate for patent protection. We require employees and consultants to execute non-disclosure and proprietary rights agreements upon commencement of employment or consulting arrangements. These agreements acknowledge our exclusive ownership of all intellectual property developed by the individuals during their work for us and require that all proprietary information disclosed will remain confidential. While such agreements may be binding, we may not be able to enforce them in all jurisdictions. 

        Although we continue to take steps to identify and protect our patentable technology and to obtain and protect proprietary rights to such technology, we cannot be certain the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology. We may, as appropriate, take legal action in the future to enforce our patents and trademarks and otherwise to protect our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets. In the future, situations may arise in which we may decide to grant additional licenses.

Research and Development 

        Since the inception of Bookham Technology plc in 1988, we have focused historically on research and development activities. We spent $54.4 million during 2001, $50.3 million during 2002, $50.4 million during 2003 and $26.9 million during the first six months of 2004 on research and development. We invested heavily in research and development in 2001 in connection with increasing our product development efforts in anticipation of an increase in demand. In response to the decline in the market and our decision to discontinue further development of our ASOC platform, we decreased these expenses in 2002. However, in 2003 principally due to the acquisition of Ignis Optics and Cierra Photonic, but also due to investment in the area of subsystems, we increased our expense for research and development. In addition, principally due to our acquisition of New Focus and Onetta, during the first six months of 2004, we increased our expense for research and development. We believe that continued focus on the development of our technology is critical to our future competitive success and our goal is to expand and develop our line of telecommunications products, particularly in the area of subsystems, to expand and develop our line of non-telecommunications products and technologies for use in a variety of different applications, enhance our manufacturing processes to reduce production costs, provide increased device performance and reduce product time to market. As of July 3, 2004, our research and development organization comprised 379 people. 

        Our research and development facilities in Abingdon, Caswell and Paignton, U.K., Santa Rosa and San Jose, California, and Ottawa, Canada, include computer-aided design stations, modern laboratories and automated test equipment. Our research and development organization has optical and electronic integration expertise that facilitates meeting customer-specific requirements as they arise. We also sponsor advanced research in a number of universities in the United Kingdom, Europe and North America. 

Manufacturing 

        We own a wafer fab facility in Caswell, U.K., a manufacturing assembly and test facility in Paignton, U.K, a manufacturing and test facility in Shenzhen, China and a manufacturing facility in San Jose, California. We also lease a wafer fab facility in Zurich, Switzerland, and a thin-film filter manufacturing facility in Santa Rosa, California. We previously had manufacturing facilities in Abingdon, Harlow and Swindon, U.K.; Columbia, Maryland; Poughkeepsie, New York; and Ottawa, Canada, all of which are now closed. During 2003, we consolidated our Ottawa manufacturing equipment and activities into our existing Caswell facility and consolidated our optical amplifier manufacturing, assembly and test operations and chip-on-carrier operations into our Paignton site. Our aggregate potential manufacturing floor space in our currently existing facilities is approximately 850,000 square feet. As a result of the economic downturn, we estimate that in 2003 we substantially underutilized our existing manufacturing capacity. In 2004, we announced a restructuring plan which included moving a majority of our assembly and test operations from Paignton to Shenzhen in order to take advantage of the comparatively low manufacturing costs in China. 

        Our manufacturing capabilities include fabrication processing for indium phosphide, gallium arsenide and thin film filters. Such capabilities include clean room facilities for each of the technology processes along with assembly and test capability and reliability/quality testing. Our manufacturing facilities house sophisticated semiconductor processing equipment, such as epitaxy reactors, metal deposition systems, photolithography, etching, analytical measurement and control equipment. Our assembly and test facilities include specialized automated assembly equipment, temperature and humidity control and reliability and testing facilities.

Competition 

        The market for our products is highly competitive. We believe we compete favorably with respect to the following factors: 

•
product quality, performance and price; 


•
confidence in future product evolution; 


•
confidence that the company will remain viable for the foreseeable future; 


•
manufacturing capabilities; and 


•
customer service and support. 
        With respect to our telecommunications products, we also compete favorably on the basis of our historical customer relationships and the breadth of our product line. 

        Although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so. 

        We encounter substantial competition in most of our markets, although no one competitor competes with us across all product lines or markets. 

        We believe that our principal competitors in telecommunications are the major suppliers of optical components and modules, including both vendors selling to third parties and components companies owned by large telecommunication equipment manufacturers. Specifically, we believe that we compete against two main categories of competitors: 

•
broad-based merchant suppliers of components, principally JDS Uniphase, Avanex and Triquint, Inc.; and 


•
the vertically integrated equipment manufacturers, such as Fujitsu. 
        In addition, market leaders in industries such as semiconductor and data communications, who may have significantly more resources than we do, may in the future enter our market with competing products. 

        In the area of photonics and microwave solutions, we compete with a number of companies including Melles Griot, Inc., Newport Corporation, Thermo Oriel (a unit of the Thermo Photonics Division of Thermo Electron Corporation), Thorlabs Inc., Miteq, Inc. and Aeroflex, Inc. 

Employees 

        As of July 3, 2004, we employed 2,024 persons, including 379 in research and development, 1,404 in manufacturing, 105 in sales and marketing, and 136 in finance and administration. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
